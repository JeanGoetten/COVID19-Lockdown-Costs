# COVID-19 Lockdown: Economic Costs

The main way adopted to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is social isolation, which can evolve into confinement. This leads to a decrease in production capacity. The objective of this work is to estimate the costs of this reduction and to correlate it with the costs of loss of production capacity due to the fatal effects of the pandemic so that government authorities can take conscious actions. 

### Method:

The initial equation considers that the aftereffects of a quarantine could result in economic losses that - exceeding the costs of losing productive capacity, would lead to social problems that could result in greater long-term losses, caracteristic of economic depression scenarios.

```
Ti = Cpcp <= Cedi * D
```

Where:

```
Ti   = isolation time
Cpcp = Cost of loss of productive capacity
Cedi = Daily economic cost for isolation
D    = isolation days
```

```
Cpcp = (z' * Pcp) + ((Ym*N)^t*(P*(M/100)) * Vicp))
```

Where:
```
z'  = average productive value in the affected age group
Pcp = loss of productive capacity (total number of deaths)
```

And: 

```
Ym  = total of fertile women dying in the pandemic
N   = local birth rate
t   = future time range of the impact of loss of birth rate to be considered
P   = população total
M   = proportion of women in the local population
```

And: 

```
Vicp = valor máximo de uma capacidade produtiva
```
